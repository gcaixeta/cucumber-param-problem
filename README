## Description

This project just isolate a problem in cucumber (or other library)

You can see the difference of param in log

When multipart => false the Params is:

Parameters: {"commit"=>"Select Categories", "attachment"=>"", "utf8"=>"\342\234\223", "category_ids"=>["22", "25"]}

When multipart => true and have a file input the Params is:

Parameters: {"commit"=>"Select Categories", "utf8"=>"\342\234\223", "category_ids"=>["2629"]}


So the params is:
"category_ids"=>["2629"]

It should be:
"category_ids"=>["26", "29"]

in the test env, with a multipart form and a file input, it merge multiple values into a single string.

This behaviour just happens in the test env. I dont know if is really a issue of cucumber or any other thing related.

tail -f log/test.log | grep Param

bundle exec cucumber features/select_categories.feature
